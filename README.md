# BlockChain Simulation

This is a project I worked on during a summer internship to help write a paper on BlockChains, the Project consists on creating a BlockChain simulation to see how removing nodes in a blockChain can impact the transmission of
Information through the BlockChain.
This is done through the use of protocols, api's, services and different
Graph related algorithms to find the best possible outcome for each problem and to get the most realistic simulation on how nodes in a BlockChain behave with one another.

In Brief, the aim is to create a blockchain in which transactions are executed in a time proportional to the distance between the two nodes involved in the transaction.
Without sacrificing any secureness.

Further details are available both in the documentation of the code and in the Research paper.
